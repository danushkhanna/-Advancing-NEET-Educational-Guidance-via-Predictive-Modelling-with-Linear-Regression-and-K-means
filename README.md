## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of academic counseling, the integration of data analytics and predictive modeling has emerged as a revolutionary approach. This repository dives deep into the realms of data exploration, predictive modeling, and clustering methodologies, all aimed at redefining the NEET educational guidance process.

## Predictive Rank Estimation

Our journey begins with a profound exploration of data analytics, uncovering hidden gems that have the potential to reshape academic counseling. We delved into the nuances of the dataset, juggling a vast repository of 100,000 entries. Intriguingly, 40% of this data contained gaps, presenting a unique challenge.

## College Clustering

Next, we dived into the realm of Linear Regression, leveraging this technique to forecast Expected Scores from NEET Ranks. We navigated the complexities of the dataset, weaving predictions into its fabric to provide personalized guidance. The outcome was a predictive model that enables tailored interventions, even for students with missing data.

## Attraction Index Computation

The project then embarked on the journey of K-means clustering, a powerful unsupervised machine learning algorithm. By applying K-means to a dataset of 400 colleges, we clustered them based on Round 1 closings and attrition rates. This strategic clustering lays the foundation for more informed counseling strategies, tailored to each college's unique story.

## Regional Trends Analysis

One of the highlights of our analysis was the computation of the "Attraction Index" for colleges. This index quantifies the allure of colleges, assigning scores that provide valuable insights. Through rigorous analysis of 324 colleges, we discovered a mean "Attraction Index" of 94.45, shedding light on the prestige and appeal of various institutions.

## Model Validation

Our exploration didn't stop there. We delved into regional trends, unearthing intriguing variations in attrition rates across different states. Visualizing this data through box plots illuminated the diverse academic landscapes of various states. To validate our predictive models, we obtained an impressive R-squared value of 0.8925, confirming the efficacy of our approach.
